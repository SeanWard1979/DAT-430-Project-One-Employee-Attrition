# DAT-430-Project-One-Employee-Attrition

## Installations
Python 3.8.12 and Jupyter Notebook 6.4.3

## Project Motivations
The baseline to establish using the HR Attrition data set involves determining which factors best predict the possibility of attrition within the company.

## Conclusions
Utilizing a correlation heatmap and looking at VIF values (for collinearity), I settled upon seven different variables that best predict the likelihood of attrition.  Performance Rating, Hourly Rate, Age, Distance from Home, Years in Current Role, Years Since Last Promotion and Education.  Using these seven variables, the Random Forest Classifier was able to obtain a F1 score of 0.85 in predicting no attrition, and a F1 score of 0.69 in predicting attrition.
